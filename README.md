- connection users with some components(like lending).

This project use engine builded on PC memory (without any dataserver), so after close window/engine all data will dissapear:(. But this project is for fun and for geting new experience:) 

How to use this project?
- Download all files,
- Open Rest-Solution file in VS,
- Run Rest-Api (scroll from IIS Express),
- Wait for open new window browser,
